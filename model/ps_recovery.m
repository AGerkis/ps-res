% Power_System_Recovery_v1.m
%
% Takes a failed network as an input and computes the recovery based on random
% samples of recovery time. Treats damaged components and disconnected
% components separately, not assigning a repair time to components 
% disconnected due to a cascading failure. Does not consider prioritization 
% of components. The result is returned in a modified version of the MATPOWER 
% case format.

% Inputs:
%   network: The AC-CFM output, with the modified formatting used for this project.
%   damaged: The set of damaged components, represented by their IDs. Organized 
%            as [branches, busses, gens].
%   n_dmg: The number of damaged components of each type, input as an array
%          with the same organization as damaged.
%   disconnected: The set of disconnected components, represented by their IDs. 
%                 Organized as [branches, busses, gens].
%   n_dc: The number of disconnected components of each type, input as an array
%         with the same organization as disconnected.
%   samples: A structure containing recovery times for each component.
%   T_workers: Number of crews able to perform recovery operations on each
%              component. Assumes that a number of crews are assigned to
%              each component type. In the format [# of workers for branch
%              repair, # of workers for node repair, # of workers for
%              generator repair].
%   pf_settings: The desired settings for the power flow computation, in the 
%                MATPOWER mopt format. (optional)
%
% Outputs:
%   recovery_results: A structure containing the results of the recovery
%   phase.
