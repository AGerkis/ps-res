% generate_contingency.m
%
% Generates a contingency set based on the failure curves of the components
% in the network by generating a random number r~uniform(0,1) and comparing
% this to the value of the failure curve at the current environmental
% state, F(env). Note that the failure curve represents the probability of
% the component failure as a function of the environmental state. Currently
% this function assumes that each component type has only one failure
% curve, where each components failure curve may have a unique
% environmental state variable.

%
% Inputs:
%   network: The network (in AC-CFM format) for which to compute the
%            contingency set.
%   f_curves: The failure curves for each component, organized as a
%             structure, with the failure curves for each component type stored
%             in separate cell arrays.
%   env_state: The environmental state variable at each time step and for 
%              each component types failure curve variable, with time steps
%              as columns and component types as rows.
%   active_set: The set of components which should be considered in
%               contingency generation. IDs should correspond to position
%               in corresponding arrays.
%
% Outputs:
%   contingency_set: An array containing the time index when each component
%                    fails, set to 0 if the component does not fail.
