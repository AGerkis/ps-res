% ps_print.m
% 
% Prints the resilience metrics computed by the power system resilience
% model to the console.
%
% Metrics are enumerated as follows:
%   1: Phi
%   2: Lambda
%   3: E
%   4: Pi
%   5: Area
%
% Indicator categories are enumerated as follows:
%   1: Operational Indicators
%   2: Infrastructural Indicators
%
% Indicators are enumerated as follows:
%   1: Load Served
%   2: Transmission lines disconnected
%
% Inputs:
%   rm: The resilience metric output structure. [struct]
%   o: The array indicating the indicators used and the metrics computed
%      for those indicators. [N_print x 2 integer]
