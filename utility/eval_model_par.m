% eval_model_par.m
%
% A wrapper function for evaluating UQ-Lab models in parallel environments.
%
% If n_r is specified then the mean and standard deviation are also
% returned.
%
% Inputs:
%   X: The input points on which to evaluate the model. [N x M]
%   o: The options for the model to evaluate OR the uq-model to evaluate. [struct]
%   n_r: The number of replications to create. [Integer] (OPTIONAL)
%
% Outputs:
%   Y: The model evaluations on X. [N x N_Out]
