% assign_rec_data.m
%
% Assigns data from input files into the correct input format for the
% resilience model. Currently accepts input data in the form of historical
% (or simulated) recovery times, from which realizations are sampled at
% run-time.
%
% If one filename is provided then the same data is provided for all
% components. Otherwise three filenames must be specified, one for each
% component. Filenames may be blank, however this should only be the case
% if component failures for that type are not modelled.
%
% Inputs:
%   fn_branch: The name of the file containing branch recovery data. [string]
%              OR
%              The name of the file containing recovery data for all components. [string]
%   fn_bus: The name of the file containing branch recovery data. [string]
%   fn_gen: The name of the file containing branch recovery data. [string]
%
% Outputs:
%   rec_data: A structure containing three fields, pertaining to the
%             recovery time samples for each component type. [struct]
%              - branch_recovery samples: Recovery data for branches. [1 x N_samples double]
%              - bus_recovery samples: Recovery data for buses. [1 x N_samples double]
%              - gen_recovery samples: Recovery data for generators. [1 x N_samples double]
