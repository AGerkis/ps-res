% restore_component.m
%
% Takes a component as an input and restores that component within the
% network. Updates all relevant component status variables.
%
% Author: Aidan Gerkis
%
% Date: 20-12-2023
%
% Inputs:
%   network: The network in which the component is being restored (in
%   MATPOWER case format).
%   comp: The component being restored, in the format [ID, type].
%   n_branch: The number of branches remaining to be restored
%   n_bus: The number of busses remaining to be restored
%   n_gen: The number of generators remaining to be restored
%
% Outputs:
%   network: The network, after restoration of the specified component.
%   n_branch: The number of branches remaining to be restored, after restoration of the specified component.
%   n_bus: The number of busses remaining to be restored, after restoration of the specified component.
%   n_gen: The number of generators remaining to be restored, after restoration of the specified component.
