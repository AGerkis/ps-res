% get_neighbours.m
%
% Returns all components connected to a given node by n or less branches.
%
% Inputs:
%   network: The network to be analyzed, in a MATPOWER case format.
%   start: The starting component, in the format [id; type].
%   n: The number of steps to take
%
% Outputs:
%   neighbours: An array of all components within n branches from the
%               starting component. Formatted as [id; type].
