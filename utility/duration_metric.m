% Calculates the duration metric of a resiliency event as a time to a 
% certain percent of restoration as specified in equation (16) of [1].

% Inputs:
%   q: The percent of restoration desired. q should be in [0, 100]
%   data: The resiliency indicator data for which the duration metric is
%       being calculated. Containing resiliency indicator data in the first 
%       row and time in the second.
%
% Outputs:
%   d: The duration metric for the given data set.
